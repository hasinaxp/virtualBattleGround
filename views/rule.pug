                    h3 Terms & Conditions
                    p At VBG, our aim is simple: to provide gamers of all skill levels with the chance to play the best games for real prizes. In order to ensure fair play, and that every member is treated with the respect they deserve, these are the rules of the game. These are our Terms and Conditions of service ("Terms and Conditions"). Abide, and we'll keep you. Break them, and you're out.

                    h3 1. Binding Terms and Conditions
                    p VBG welcomes you. These Terms and Conditions apply to websites and interactive services (individually a "Service" and collectively the "Services") owned or operated by ACE Entertainment Pvt. Ltd. and its subsidiaries and affiliates ("VBG", "we" or "us"). By registering for an account and becoming a member to participate in any game or tournament offered on VBG.in (the "Website") or the VBG mobile apps on Android and iOS (the “App”) you confirm your knowledge of and you give your unconditional consent to be bound by these Terms and Conditions, which can be accessed from the Website or mobile App. 

                    p VBG.in may modify/update/change these Terms and Conditions at any time, without any prior notice. You are responsible for reviewing these Terms and Conditions periodically for any modifications. Your continued use of the Website or App following such modifications signifies your acceptance of those modifications. Additional terms may apply to your use of any Service, including contest rules and eligibility. We will provide these terms to you or post them on the website pages to which they apply; they are incorporated by reference into these Terms and Conditions. If there is a conflict between these Terms and Conditions and any additional terms that apply to a particular Service, the additional terms will control. As set out in more detail below, VBG RESERVES THE RIGHT TO IMMEDIATELY SUSPEND AND/OR CLOSE THE ACCOUNT OF ANY MEMBER WHO VIOLATES, OR WHOM VBG REASONABLY BELIEVES MAY BE OR WILL BE VIOLATING, THESE TERMS AND CONDITIONS OF SERVICE, AT ANY TIME WITHOUT NOTICE. 

                    p Please note that if a member's account is closed due to a violation of the Terms and Conditions, VBG reserves the right to determine how the member's account balance will be distributed.

                    h3 2. Eligibility and Restrictions on Participation
                    p 2.1 Eligibility
                    p In order to register and maintain an account on the Website, an individual must: be a natural person, at least eighteen (18) years old, and who has had the email address submitted on the account registration form assigned to their use and control as represented; be physically located in a Territory in which participation in the Service you select, or the Website, is unrestricted by applicable laws; and comply with these Terms and Conditions at all times. All registered account holders except from the State of Orissa and Assam may choose to fund their accounts and also play entry fee or cash tournaments. Currently, due to the laws applicable in Assam and Orissa VBG.in shall not be providing services in all such prohibited territories mentioned herein. VBG.in is under no obligation to, and does not, accept funded accounts from members in all Territories and may at any time refuse to permit the funding of a member's account. If you open an account and/or participate in any tournament or game offered on the Website while located in a prohibited jurisdiction, you will be in violation of the law of such jurisdictions and these Terms and Conditions, and subject to having your account suspended or terminated and all winnings (if any) shall stand void ab initio and be liable to forfeiture. .

                    p 2.2 Information Required
                    p Upon registration and/ or during the processing of transferring funds into your account, you are required to provide the following information: an alias that will be your username, a password, your email address, full name, phone number, credit card or other payment information, & gender. The information provided must be true, accurate, current and complete, as requested. You agree to update the registration data to keep it current and accurate. If VBG determines you are registering with purposely incorrect information, it reserves the right to close your account. Knowingly submitting incomplete or inaccurate information will result in immediate termination of your account and forfeiture of any prizes or winnings to which you may have otherwise been entitled. VBG also reserves the right, in its sole discretion, to change and/or suspend/terminate offensive usernames. Make it fun if you like, but keep it clean. Please note that you will need to make a deposit to your VBG Account if you choose to play for money.

                    p 2.3 Proof of Eligibility
                    p VBG may at any time require any member to provide proof of eligibility to participate in order to continue to allow such member access to the Website and the Services, and each member hereby acknowledges and accepts this condition of their participation as a reasonable measure to ensure the security of the Website. In addition, each member will be required to provide proper identification and proof of eligibility prior to receiving a prize or the processing by VBG of any withdrawal request. Participants may, at their option, pre-register their identification at any time prior to submitting a withdrawal request. FAILURE TO PROVIDE EVIDENCE OF IDENTIFICATION AND/OR ELIGIBILITY SATISFACTORY TO VBG, IN ITS SOLE AND ABSOLUTE DISCRETION, SHALL RESULT IN THE SUSPENSION AND/OR TERMINATION OF THE MEMBER'S ACCOUNT. For accounts that are terminated due to non-eligibility, funds previously deposited to the account will be refunded to the account holder.

                    p 2.4 Limitations on Participation
                    p You are only permitted to register one active account on the Website and the App combined. Additionally, VBG only allows users to have only one account. VBG reserves the right to monitor any effort to establish multiple accounts. In the event it is discovered that you have opened more than one account, all accounts will be closed without notice. VBG reserves the right to deny access to anyone, including, but not limited to, those members who use proxy servers and/or IP addresses residing in certain geographical areas. VBG may impose amount limitations on the transactions in which you engage to fund your activities on the Website or the App. VBG reserves the right to limit your activity on the Website in any way it deems appropriate, in its sole discretion. VBG reserves the right to set expiration dates or other limits on all promotional or bonus funds or credits, including entry fee bonuses or credits and prize credits applied to your account.

                    p 2.5 Violation of the Terms and Conditions and Abuse: Liability
                    pAny member who displays behaviour which may be interpreted as the use of unfair methods on the Website or the App, including but not limited to, the opening and/or use of multiple accounts, the use of unauthorized or altered software or hardware to assist play, intentionally poor play in certain games in order to achieve a broader competitive advantage (i.e. "sandbagging"), harassment of other participants, posting of objectionable material, any breach of these Terms and Conditions, or any breach or attempted breach of the security of your account or the Website (collectively, "Abuse"), shall be subject to immediate sanction (as determined by VBG in its sole discretion), up to and including account termination and blocking of Website/ App access, the voiding of any funds and winnings, in the case of money laundering or any other illegal activity, disclosure to the appropriate police authorities, and legal action at the sole discretion of VBG.

                    p 2.6 Accounts for Individual Use Only
                    p You, as the holder of your account, are solely responsible for all obligations and, assuming compliance with these Terms and Conditions, are entitled to all benefits accruing thereto. You may not allow any other person to access your account, access the Website, accept any winnings, or participate in any tournament using your account information. Your account is not transferable to any other person. All activities undertaken under a member's account will be deemed to have been done by that member.

                    h3 3. Games
                    p 3.1 Skilled Gaming for Prizes
                    p Each member acknowledges that the outcome of the matches and tournaments offered on the Website/App are directly related to the number of members participating, and the skill levels of each member participating. VBG does not comment or have knowledge of the probability of one member winning a match vs. another member, and makes no representations about an individual member's chances of winning. Prizes are generally cash amounts, which are deposited directly into winners' VBG wallets that have chosen to play for cash. The cash value of prizes offered in Limited Entry tournaments will be disclosed at the beginning of such tournaments. If a tournament has to close prematurely, such as for maintenance or technical problems, the prize for the tournament will be determined by the Website.

                    p 3.2 Determination of Winners
                    p The results and winners of each tournament offered on the Website/ App will be determined by VBG, and such determinations will be final. By registering and/or participating in any tournament, you agree to be bound by these determinations

                    p 3.3 Game Play
                    p VBG is not responsible for technical, hardware or software malfunctions, lost or unavailable network connections, disconnects from your game play on your platform, or any incorrect or inaccurate results that may be posted on your online game. You may not: (a) gain unauthorized access to the Website's systems or any account (other than your own), interfere with the communications, procedures or performance of the Website or deliberately damage or undermine the Website; (b) affect the outcome of your online game play on your platform by means of or with the assistance of macros, bots, automated programs, screen analysis utilities, player collusion, any type of modifications, memory readers, telepathy, alien technology or similar methods or to otherwise commit fraud in relation to the Website/ App; or (c) alter the human skill component of any game played on your platform. Any attempt to do so is a violation of both civil and criminal laws and will result not only in the termination of your user account and forfeiture of all winnings, bonuses and incentives to which you would otherwise be entitled, but potentially lead to civil and/or criminal prosecution. The Website/ App, in its sole discretion, reserves the right to terminate any person's account who is suspected of tampering with their game results for the tournament entered, or who otherwise violates these rules and to seek legal enforcement to the greatest extent possible, including referral to criminal prosecution authorities. Disputes: First time offenders deemed to have knowingly violated the Terms and Conditions may receive an initial warning along with a minimum penalty of a thirty (30) day account suspension. Repeat offenders will be deemed to be intentionally violating the Terms and Conditions and will face a minimum six (6) month suspension for a second violation and permanent suspension for a third violation. Any dispute filed without evidence will be considered invalid. Match Result Disputes: Any and all match evidence must be sent to support within two (2) hours of the scheduled match start time. This two (2) hour review period will be used by Website administrators to examine match evidence and to assign the win to the appropriate user. Any dispute that is filed without evidence will be considered invalid. If only one party submits evidence during this two (2) hour time frame the user that provides the evidence will be deemed the winner of the match, while the opposing user will receive a loss. If no evidence has been reported by either party within the two (2) hour time frame the match will be cancelled or marked as incomplete with monies returned to both users’ accounts. 

                    p Once a match has been cancelled and marked incomplete, the results are irreversible and cannot be adjusted. The VBG Support team has the sole discretion to ask users to provide additional evidence in order to determine the accurate winner. After thirty six (36) hours all match results will be final with no undoing, cancelling, or re assigning winners. Unresolved matches: If a winner cannot be established from an investigation by the VBG Support team then both users will have the monies refunded less the management fee as administered by VBG. Claiming a false win: If a user claims a “win” in a match that was either; not played, not completed, drawn or lost, an automatic forfeit and suspension will be issued, following on the suspension guideline listed above. Submitting false evidence: If a user submits “false evidence”; evidence that has previously been submitted or archived from a previous match, evidence that has been altered in any way, or false evidence that has been created, then that user will automatically forfeit the match and immediately face a suspension, based on the suspension guideline listed above. Abusive behaviour on platform: Any abusive, obscene, lewd, threatening or insulting behaviour by a user towards VBG Support staff or other players on the VBG Website will result in their immediate suspension for an indefinite period of time as determined by VBG Support staff. Sending multiple tickets associated with the same issue will result in disciplinary action following the suspension guideline. Cheating: Any users who are caught cheating/boosting their statistics in any match on VBG will be suspended, based on the suspension guideline listed above. If cheating or boosting of records occurs during any bracket, leaderboard, or ladder style tournament, the user will be immediately disqualified with no entry fee reimbursement. Lagging and IP Booting: Users who are caught lagging/IP booting matches will face an automatic loss and suspension. The suspension penalty will follow the suspension guideline listed above. When disputing a lagging match, video evidence of the lag is required in order for your dispute to be validated. You must be able to provide video evidence that clearly identifies the exit of the match. When playing a match with a poor connectivity level, be sure to quit before either you or your opponent gain a significant advantage in the match. When a user disconnects from a match while their opponent has a significant advantage, the user who disconnected will receive an automatic loss. If the match is played and completed in its entirety, the results of the match will stand. The VBG Support team has the sole discretion to adjust end match results at any time.
